def _np_reshape(a, newshape, order='C'):
    """
    reshape(a, newshape, order='C')

    Gives a new shape to an array without changing its data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Array to be reshaped.
    newshape : int or tuple of ints
        The new shape should be compatible with the original shape. If
        an integer, then the result will be a 1-D array of that length.
        One shape dimension can be -1. In this case, the value is
        inferred from the length of the array and remaining dimensions.
    order : {'C'}, optional
        Read the elements of `a` using this index order, and place the
        elements into the reshaped array using this index order.  'C'
        means to read / write the elements using C-like index order,
        with the last axis index changing fastest, back to the first
        axis index changing slowest. Other order types such as 'F'/'A'
        may be added in the future.

    Returns
    -------
    reshaped_array : ndarray
        It will be always a copy of the original array. This behavior is different
        from the official NumPy package where views of the original array may be
        generated.

def _np_ones_like(a):
    """Return an array of ones with the same shape and type as a given array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        The shape and data-type of `a` define these same attributes of
        the returned array.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray

    ----------
    a : ndarray

        the returned array.

    Returns
    -------

def _np_repeat(a, repeats, axis=None):
    """Repeat elements of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input array.
    repeats : int or array of ints
        The number of repetitions for each element.  `repeats` is broadcasted
        to fit the shape of the given axis.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which to repeat values.  By default, use the
        flattened input array, and return a flat output array.

    Returns
    -------
    repeated_array : ndarray
        Output array which has the same shape as `a`, except along
        the given axis.
    """

def _np_cumsum(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None):
    """cumsum(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None)

    Return the cumulative sum of the elements along a given axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Input array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the cumulative sum is computed. The default
        (None) is to compute the cumsum over the flattened array.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed.  If `dtype` is not specified, it defaults
        to the dtype of `a`.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape, type and buffer length as the expected output.

    Returns
    -------
    cumsum_along_axis : ndarray.
        A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is
        specified, in which case a reference to `out` is returned. The
        result has the same size as `a`, and the same shape as `a` if
        `axis` is not None or `a` is a 1-d array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
    >>> a
    array([[1., 2., 3.],
           [4., 5., 6.]])

def _np_dot(a, b, out=None):
    """dot(a, b, out=None)

    Dot product of two arrays. Specifically,
    
    - If both `a` and `b` are 1-D arrays, it is inner product of vectors
    
    - If both `a` and `b` are 2-D arrays, it is matrix multiplication,
    
    - If either `a` or `b` is 0-D (scalar), it is equivalent to :func:`multiply`
      and using ``np.multiply(a, b)`` or ``a * b`` is preferred.
    
    - If `a` is an N-D array and `b` is a 1-D array, it is a sum product over
      the last axis of `a` and `b`.
    
    - If `a` is an N-D array and `b` is a 2-D array, it is a
      sum product over the last axis of `a` and the second-to-last axis of `b`::
    
        dot(a, b)[i,j,k] = sum(a[i,j,:] * b[:,k])

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        First argument.
    b : ndarray
        Second argument.
    
    out : ndarray, optional
        Output argument. It must have the same shape and type as the expected output.

    Returns
    -------
    output : ndarray
        Returns the dot product of `a` and `b`.  If `a` and `b` are both
        scalars or both 1-D arrays then a scalar is returned; otherwise
        an array is returned.
        If `out` is given, then it is returned

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array(3)
    >>> b = np.array(4)
    >>> np.dot(a, b)
    array(12.)

    For 2-D arrays it is the matrix product:

    >>> a = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]])
    >>> b = np.array([[4, 1], [2, 2]])
    >>> np.dot(a, b)
