def norm(x, ord=None, axis=None, keepdims=False):
    r"""Matrix or vector norm.

    This function can only support Frobenius norm for now.
    The Frobenius norm is given by [1]_:

        :math:`||A||_F = [\sum_{i,j} abs(a_{i,j})^2]^{1/2}`

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray
        Input array.
    ord : {'fro'}, optional
        Order of the norm.
    axis : {int, 2-tuple of ints, None}, optional
        If `axis` is an integer, it specifies the axis of `x` along which to
        compute the vector norms.  If `axis` is a 2-tuple, it specifies the
        axes that hold 2-D matrices, and the matrix norms of these matrices
        are computed.  If `axis` is None, the norm of the whole ndarray is
        returned.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are normed over are left in the
        result as dimensions with size one.  With this option the result will
        broadcast correctly against the original `x`.

    Returns
    -------
    n : float or ndarray
        Norm of the matrix or vector(s).
